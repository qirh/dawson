	  <p>My name is Saleh, I'd like to tell you about my best friend.</p>
          <p>I look up to him a lot. So much so, that often times, he feels more like a moral compass to me than just a friend.</p>
          <p>I think a lot about him, he's very quirky in really funny ways and he nose don't work, so he can't smell.</p>
          <p>We don't talk very often, not as much as I want. I think that's because I think about him all the time so much so that he's always in my heart.</p>
